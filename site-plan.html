      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>This site is where I can share my hobbies and insights with other people that are interested in stories, games, and other media I have enjoyed. The main page should be a general greeting page, linking out to the subpages (probably a page for a given type of media) which would would list and give details for the series/games/etc. of that media.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This site is a mix of information and my insights, for people that are intersted in finding a new series or just curious in what I have to share about something I am a fan of. Overall, it should feel informative but casual, like a friend invited over to share in a fun activity.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        For the Home page, I want to introduce visitors to the purpose of my site. I want to share my interests with others, as well as my insights about those interests. Some may be fairly small, others may be more in-depth. I am considering categorizing things based on media type, series, or author, depending on what best fits that content. On the Home page, it will more basic and intended to begin to guide a visitor to find a series, music, story, etc. that they might have curiosity in. The title is an attempt at a type of Japanese pun in that “suisen” as written refers to a water faucet but read as if it were a form of recommend. Thus it is an open faucet of the things with my recommend (or not, in some cases), using my online name “Jarie”.
        <br>
        <br>
        Example of the main descriptive text: Welcome to Jarie Suisen, a place where I can share the things I love with you! You may already be a fan or curious about what the next story you should try. I have lots of answers, whether or not they are the answer you are looking for is up to you. Although the idea may be similar, this is not a wiki. I have pages for various books, games, music, and more, where I give details about the series from my perspective. My opinions for some may be relatively short while others may be a dive into my love for them. Either way, I am a fan of hundreds of things and want to help anyone that is curious to share in that enjoyment.

      </ul>
      <h3>Category: Books</h3>
      <p>
        Page 2 is going to be one of the category pages, where it starts to break out into the different series or other specific topics. In this case, I am thinking that focusing on books may be the better starting point since then the third page can be of the original book series of The Wizard of Oz, which is public domain. In discussing books, I want to note the differences between novels and comic books and why I enjoy both media. This page will also provide lists of specific books or book series that I have read.
        <br>
        <br>
        Example of the main descriptive text: Books are a wonderful form of media that allows the imagination nearly unparallel potential for the ultimate stage performance. I have loved reading since I was a child and am so glad that I have been able to enjoy so many different worlds in these magical experiences. The voices for a character are not defined, the sounds of battle, the dramatic movements that a character may have, it’s all up to the reader! No other media gives quite this level of potential for the person enjoying it to truly immerse their whole self inside the setting. Of course, that isn’t a good fit for every person, and as sad as I feel about it I hope that perhaps I can share some amount of the pleasure I find in these stories with you.

      </ul>
      <h3>Series: The Wizard of Oz</h3>
      <p>
        Page 3 is to be a specific-detail page, in this case the original Frank Baum books of the Wizard of Oz series. In this instance it is largely because the content is public domain, which allows me to use the books’ content without worrying about copyright. (This is actually fortunate, because there are so very many series that I am a fan of and this helped me narrow it down nicely.) Here, I will share my thoughts about the series as well as an attempt at sharing details that don’t ruin the experience of reading the story for the first time. Despite how old and famous the series is now, many people are more familiar with the live action film… which, while it will have a page of its own the basic review for that film is “No, just go read the books.”
        <br>
        <br>
        Example of the main descriptive text: The entirety of the original books of The Wizard of Oz series were written by Frank Baum over 100 years ago. Despite the passage of so much time, they stand as iconic tales of adventure and magic for children of all ages. Baum wrote them with the desire for children to have a wonderful, magic-filled adventure that wasn’t burdened with teaching morals. Rather, it depicts a spunky young girl who experiences the land of Oz and ends up befriending various characters and defying the dangers to be found as she searches for a way home. In later adventures, she and other children each discover new parts of Oz and the lands surrounding it as the history and mysteries of the land are revealed to the reader. Whenever I talk about my love of Oz, the first thing I do is ask if they’ve seen the movie or read the book to which the reply is nearly always that they have only seen the film. The look of surprise as they learn that Dorothy is just a little girl and that she has far more adventures always feels me with a bit of sadness. However, the enjoyment that they later find from the original books since that time is always a source of joy!
