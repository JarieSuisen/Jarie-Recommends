        <h1>The Oz series, by L. Frank Baum</h1>

            <h2>My opening thoughts</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Oz! This series was probably the first I ever knew of as a series. 
                When I was a kid, my mother read these books to us before bed.
                Admittedly, I didn't pay a lot of attention at the time and tended to fall asleep (I needed to be doing something myself to stay awake).
                I had no idea that my mom was basically doing what L. Frank Baum would do for his kids about 100 years before: sharing stories with them.
                <br>
                Despite the passage of so much time, these tales stand as iconic tales of adventure and magic for children of all ages. 
                Baum wrote them with the desire for children to have a wonderful, magic-filled adventure that wasn't burdened with teaching morals. 
                Rather, it depicts a spunky young girl who experiences the wonders of a magical land and befriends various characters while defying dangers as she searches for a way home. 
                In later adventures Dorothy and other children discover new parts of Oz and the lands surrounding it as the history and mysteries of the land are revealed to the reader. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Whenever I talk about my love of Oz, the first thing I do is ask if the other person has seen the movie or read the book. 
                Sadly, the reply is nearly always that they have only seen the "classic" film. 
                The look of surprise as I inform them that Dorothy is actually a little girl and that she has far more adventures is fun, but comes with a feeling of sadness that the wonder of the wonderful book was lost to a mediocre film. 
                (Yes, I don't think highly of that film. I don't care how much people love "Over the Rainbow", it's sad that the film leaves out so much wonder to fill it with a wishy-washy singalong.)
                However, the enjoyment that they later find from reading the original books (or having them read to them) afterwards is always a source of joy!
                All that to say, if you only know of Oz from the live action film(s), you don't know what you are missing out on!
                And, guess what? The books are public domain (the whole original series!), so you can legally just read them whenever you want, no cost necessary!
                <br>
                <br>Baum was a wonderful writer and a good soul. He was the kind of person that was truly apalled by the horrible things people can do. 
                As such, he wrote his books such that although evil never wins, the heroes don't turn to cruelty. 
                That's not to say they won't fight back (you do not want to get the Tin Woodman angry, he keeps his axe sharp!), but they will always try to be kind and helpful.
                I love how the adventures are so detailed and different from what you could encounter in most other stories. 
                You can really feel that you are in magical other lands, rather than just the real world with a bit of magic (like in other stories like Harry Potter).
                Places like an underground city with glass domes or a region where the hills literally roll.
                I think this really helped set the stage for me to enjoy the more magical settings of Xanth and Dungeons and Dragons.
                <br>
                <br>
                There are complaints one might have, to which I would reply "stop worrying so hard" or "stop being so nitpicky."
                The main issue people come across is contradictory backstory lore. (Note: BACKSTORY, which means it isn't really relevant to the plot. It's like whipped cream on an angel food cake: not actually necessary, but nice to have.)
                I don't think Baum was lazy, but perhaps he just didn't think to re-read everything to make sure he had background details consistent.
                Maybe he actually did desire to re-write the past version of the lore but didn't believe in releasing an altered version of the past books. (Like George Lucas with his changes to Star Wars IV-VI. Han shot first, it's just better that way.)
                Or, perhaps it did make sense to him in a way that just doesn't for most people.
                Either way, it can be confusing to learn that the Wizard overthrew the previous monarch and hid his daughter, Ozma, to Mombi, then had the Emerald Palace constructed.
                But then, you learn Ozma has been around for hundreds if not thousands of years from when the land original became magical.
                Honestly, that's about the only real complaint I know of, and it's really not a big deal since those are past events that barely, if at all, have any matter in the stories told.

            <h2>Characters</h2>
            <p>Throughout the books, there are quite the interesting array of characters. 
                <br>For starters, Dorothy is an active young girl that is willing to do what she needs to do and enjoy her adventures.
                Her age is never explicitly stated, but she's about 11 years old when she and her aunt and uncle move to Oz (in book six, the Emerald City of Oz).
                Based on the original artworks, it seems that she started having grand adventures as young as 5 or so!
                Were her aunt and uncle worried about her? Oh yeah, she was missing for a fair time! (Not some silly "it was all a dream". Ugh.)
                And she does all she can to make sure that she is able to help them out, despite all the challenges and dangers.
                Eventually, she even has them summoned to Oz to live in well-deserved comfort after the farm becomes bankrupt. (Although they still choose a simple life in Oz, Dorothy is recognized as a Princess of Oz.)
                I highly recommend you check out the inspiration for her character, detailed on the wikipedia page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</a>, it is truly heartwarming.
                <br>
                <br>Of course, there is the iconic trio of the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman (whose original name was Nick Chopper), and the Cowardly Lion.
                But the cast expands with each book, introducing new and wonderful personalities.
                Among others, there is Ozma, the fairy princess of Oz (it's true ruler). She had been transformed and trapped as a servant boy to wicked old Mombi, without even her memories.
                Ozma escaped and was restored to her true self thanks to the help of her companions Jack Pumpkinhead, a stick man with a pumpkin for a head, and the Sawhorse, a literal sawhorse brought to life.
                Others from outside of Oz have ventured in, such as Trot, Betsy Bobbin, and Button-Bright.
                A number of animals have joined alonside Toto, including Dorothy's cat, Eureka, and a chicken that washed ashore with Dorothy, named Billina.
                Some of my favorite characters include joyous Polychrome, one of the daughters of the Rainbow, the selfish Glass Cat, and the myterious Woozy.
                Oh, and Toto actually can talk, and has been able to do so since the first book, he just makes it a point that he avoids doing so.
                <br>
                
            </p>
            <h2>Setting</h2>
            <p>
                Honestly, I'm not sure what to say about setting. 
                It's magical, whimsical, and I just don't get how anyone can picture a magical land and not use Oz as some starting point.
                There are the somewhat color-based major regions (though not the extreme that some depictions make them) as well as the Emerald City. 
                However, there are many other locations that are explored both within the bounds of Oz and outside. 
                Some of those other areas bear dangerous enemies to the peace of Oz, such as the grumpy and cruel Gnome King. 
                And within Oz there are many regions with magical uniqueness, such as rolling hills (they literally roll, like in some Mario games, making travel difficult).
                There are creatures that have remained in isolation or hidden away so that they haven't attracted attention until the characters come across them.
