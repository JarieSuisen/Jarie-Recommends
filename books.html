        <h1>Books</h1>
        
        <div class="textbox">
            <h2>My Background with Books</h2>
            <p>I love books. Or, more accurately, I love the stories contained within them! 
                I have loved reading since I was a child and am so glad that I have been able to enjoy so many different worlds in these magical experiences.
                When I was a child, my mother would read to us kids before bed. 
                The main books I recall were the Oz series, The Hobbit, and The Lord of the Rings. 
                Naturally, each of those books are parts of those good memories. 
                Admittedly, it wasn't until I was older and read them myself that I actually got the whole story... I fell asleep too easily when I wasn't doing things myself.
                The first books I recall reading on my own (not counting school assignments) were from the Animorphs series. 
                It was around fourth or fifth grade when I started the Landover series, which launched me into the wider world of literature.
                As a childhood fan of various video games and shows from Japan, I naturally dived into manga as soon as I first came across them in high school. 
                (In the time, mid-90's, and place, a very small town, where I grew up, there wasn't really much of a chance to come across manga.)
                Needless to say, as much as I love a good novel, I likely love many more manga series. 
                The combination of art and story makes for such wonderful storytelling. 
                Now, while I do recognize manga as being comics... I cannot consider them the same. 
                One of my favorite descriptions of manga is that they are "like watching a movie in paper format."
                When it comes to American comics, I always had an interest in the Sunday comic pages (who doesn't?), I never got into American comics very much. 
                My parents had a few comic collections from among Calvin and Hobbes, Baby Blues, and The Far Side, which I naturally read all of each of them. 
                But I never felt a drive to seek them out. And even less so for the big comics, such as from Marvel, DC, and such. 
                Fortunately, I have found that there are some I do enjoy enough to seek out, but they are very few.
                Instead, web comics are where I found my fix for English-language comics!
                I had come across a few webcomics before, but I never really got into any until I was introduced to Webtoons, a site and app that is for hosting and reading web comics.
                But once I did, I found so many wonderful series! Some have even been released in print form that I was able to purchase for my physical collection.

            <h2>Other Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Books are a wonderful form of media that allows the imagination a nearly unparalleled potential for the ultimate stage performance. 
                The sound of a character's voice, the noise of various effects, and how everything and everyone in the story is moving is up to the reader to fully interpret. 
                Even a comic's image and sound effects leave most of the immersive details to the imagination!
                No other media gives quite this level of potential for the person enjoying it to truly dive inside the setting. 
                (I suppose someone could take that literally and point out VR is a thing... to which I'd smile and <b>not</b> say out loud "Yeah, and where is my access to The World from .Hack// now? Still not actually close to being reality, as much as I would like it to be.")
                Of course, those points don't automatically make a book a good fit for every person, and as sad as that fact makes me feel, I hope thatI can share some amount of the pleasure I find in these stories with you, even if you never read them yourself.</p>
